## Trivial Web Portal
This is the code for the webportal I made to input questions to my quiz game Trivial Roulette. I needed an easy way to manage the questions and make it possible for others to contribute.
I used React as a frontend and Express running on Node as backend. This is and old project of mine but I want (if I have the time) to split it up into two different repos and re-write it using Typescript. 

Current hosting for the portal:

Current hosting for the game:
